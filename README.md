# Semantic Analysis of SCRATCH projects

This is a replication package for our paper "Scratch Projects as a Mirror of Society".

By analysing all natural language artefacts involved in a dataset of 296,112 SCRATCH projects, 
we determine to what extent text mining is possible in SCRATCH projects, which topics are common within those projects, and whether and how
socially relevant events are reflected.
